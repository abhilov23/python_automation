#to take input from the user, we use a 
#method i.e: input()
a = input()
print(a)
#but eventually we need to know which type of input you need to go with
#and for that you need to use type function

a = input("Enter a number: ") #you can also add the comments in your input function
print(type(a)) #and this will reflect the type of input you are taking
